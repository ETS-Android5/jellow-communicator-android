//TEMP CHANGES

 Trying to implement Edit Board Functionality into the Make My Board.
 So, for that making some changes into the IconSelectActivity :
 Initial Approach:
 1. Send a token to IconSelectActivity from MyBoard screen to Identify the Board Edit mode.
 2. Use the token and set a global variable | EDIT_MODE = TRUE /FALSE
 3. Fetch Board from the database and store all the present Icons into list current board list.
 4. In left-hand-side category pane, start the list by showing current board icons.
 5. There should be no Icon Selected and every icons is treated as a different icon with no linkage with already present icons,
    So, the newly added Icon will be just appended into the already present IconModel.
 6. Merge both models and start AddEditScreen with newly added icons.


//23rd November | Step to solve the Save problem

 * Trying to remove the Icon Image that I've added to the SQLite database, Instead of that try to save the image locally
   then fetch as all the other Icons.
 STEP 1: Initially, changing the board option only.
   * Store the image into local storage /boardicon/boardID.png
   * Replace the image when board is editing, first delete then again save with same name
   * On deleting the board delete the image from database
   * Keep track of all such images, and upload to firebase when needed.

VERBIAGE DATABASE

Verbiage database is for storing the data of verbiage according to the new verbiage model.

COLUMN:          ICON_ID         ICON_TITLE      ICON_VERBIAGE_OBJECT
=====================================================================

FUNCTIONS:
1. getVerbiageById(Icon id);                                                        DONE
2. getVerbiageByTitle(Icon title);                                                  DONE

4. getVerbiageForLevelTwo(int levelOneParent);                                      DEPRECATED
5. getVerbiageForLevelThree(int levelOneParent, int levelTwoParent);                DEPRECATED
6. createDatabase();                                                                DONE
